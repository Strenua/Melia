Melia is currently in the early alpha stages, so don't expect too much of it yet :)
Take a look at some of the screenshots in data/media, especially the ones that say 'plexydesk', which use http://github.com/siraj/plexydesk

-- TO TEST --
Install python (>=2.4), pygtk2, pycairo, python-gconf, ConfigParser, python-wnck
$ git clone git://github.com/Strenua/Melia.git
$ ./run.py
If you have any errors, pastebin the entire output and send it to @crazedpsyc

-- TO INSTALL --
NOT RECOMMENDED! But if you really want to...
install python-distutils-extra
$ sudo python setup.py install

----
Have fun, and please contribute if you can!
